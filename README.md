# stopwatch-project
In this project, I implemented a fully functional stopwatch that tracks time in real-time. Here are some of the key features I developed:

1)Real-Time Time Tracking⏳: The stopwatch accurately counts hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds, providing precise timekeeping for various activities. 
2)User-Friendly Interface🎛️: The application includes a clean and intuitive user interface designed for seamless interaction. Users can easily start, stop, and reset the timer with dedicated buttons. 
3)Responsive Button Effects🎨: I added hover effects to the Start, Stop, and Reset buttons to enhance user experience. The buttons change color upon hover, making the interface more interactive and visually appealing. 
4)Modular Design: The code is structured to allow easy modifications and additions, demonstrating my ability to create scalable software solutions.

This project not only reinforced my programming skills in Python but also deepened my understanding of GUI design principles and event-driven programming. 💻✨
